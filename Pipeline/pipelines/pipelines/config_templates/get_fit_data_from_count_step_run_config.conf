#Table describing samples and factors(groups). Contains  columns: Sample, Factor1, Factor2, ...
#sample_group_table =
               
#external provided experiment design factor table file (generated using R and sample_group_table using model.matrix function). If not provided (design=Null) then autogenerate design table based on sample_factor_info, using simple linear model where each factor is independent, no interactions. design table :rows are sample IDs, columns are factors of experiments. The table should have row names (sampleIDs), no column for sample IDs. Example of design table in Examples/design.csv
#design_table =

#the k parameter for batch effect removal algorithm, representing the number of unwanted factors. The more k the more normalized datasets but the cons is dataset is overnormalized that can decrease the sensitivity of catching master regulators in nScoreif k =0, then not execute batch effect removal algorithm
