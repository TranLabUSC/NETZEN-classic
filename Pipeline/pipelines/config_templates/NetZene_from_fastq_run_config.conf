#external provided experiment design table file (generated using R and sample_group_table using model.matrix function). If not provided (design=Null) then autogenerate design table based on sample_factor_info, using simple linear model where each factor is independent, no interactions. design table :rows are sample IDs, columns are factors of experiments. The table should have row names (sampleIDs), no column for sample IDs. Example of design table in Examples/design.csv. Complicated design would need interactions. Design interaction by formula. For more help, search help for model.matrix function in Rstudio. Example of R script to get design matrix in Examples/get_design_matrix.R

Example: Examples/contrast_network_table.csv.        This file usually generated using R (Examples/making_contrast_table.R
